# Project INST3260204
#DOCUMENTATION
#To run the code, just put in your CLI python scratchpaper1.py then answer the prompts depending on how many scratch off tickets you want to generate and how much each of them should cost. Then, it will generate a different file scratchoffs.txt with all the matrices in there with the prizes included. In the command line it will show you all the prizes you won with statistics that you can use. To change the probabilities, you can edit the probabilities to whatever you would like as long as it adds up to 1.
